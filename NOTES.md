as far as i know, there is one important issue in scribus for some types of comics: we cannot produce pure black and white or grayscale PDFs. while text is pure black, PNG images are imported as RGB. the result is that you get all the plates, which was an issue in the past but might be less of a problem with newer printing workflows. (afaik, it was more a cost issue rather than a technical one; but you could also could see a difference between the black from the images and the bubbles).
but i don't think MS Publisher can produce them either, so it's probably not a stopper for you.
